# Discussion

  The rump kernels provide existing real world drivers from netbsd.  Since DDE no longer seems like a promising approach to get drivers for the Hurd, it appears that rump kernels are the best alternative.  It already does the hard work of providing an environment where the foreign drivers can run, and offers the additional benefit of being externally maintained. Rump also offers the necessary facilities for running all drivers in separate userspace processes, which is more desirable than drivers running in the microkernel.
