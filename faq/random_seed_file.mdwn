[[!meta title="During installation I get Failed to read random seed file"]]

More precisely, during the Debian installation, around the extraction of the netdde package one gets:

    /hurd/random: Warning: Failed to read random seed file /var/lib/random-seed: (system kern) error with unknown subsystem

This is a harmless glitch.
