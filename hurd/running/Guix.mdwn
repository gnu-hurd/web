# Documentation

As Hurd support is integrated in Guix, the official documentation (<https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/>) also works for Hurd. 

Guix has even support in its configuration language for creating Hurd VMs from a running Guix system (<https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#The-Hurd-in-a-Virtual-Machine>).

# Status

At the time of writing, the official Guix manual says that "This configuration is experimental and under development. The easiest way for you to give it a try is by setting up an instance of hurd-vm-service-type on your GNU/Linux machine (see hurd-vm-service-type). See Contributing, on how to help!" (<https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#GNU-Distribution>).
