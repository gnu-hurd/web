[[!meta title="Porting Rust"]]

The goal of this project is to make the [Rust
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) available on GNU/Hurd.

Presumably less work will be needed on the language's frontend itself, but
rather on the supporting libraries.


The Rust language is being used more and more widely, and notably in
rather fundamental libraries such as librsvg or python-cryptography. It
is thus more and more pressing for GNU/Hurd to have a compiler for Rust.

The Rust compiler itself is quite portable, but its runtime library, libstd,
needs to be ported to the GNU/Hurd system. This essentially consists in telling
Rust how the standard C library functions can be called.

And example of the main part of such port can be seen for the [VxWorks
port](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/src/vxworks/mod.rs)

The bulk of such a file can be mostly generated from the libc C
headers thanks to the bindgen tool, it then needs to be cleaned up and
integrated into the Rust build infrastructure, some preliminary work had
already been investigated in that part.

A good level of C programming will be welcome to understand the
questions of ABI and the libc C functions being bound.

Knowing the Rust language is not required: it can be learnt along the
way, this can be a good occasion.
